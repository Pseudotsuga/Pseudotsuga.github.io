# 301-401 Bridge Course Blog
> The purpose of this blog is to chronicle my progress in preparing for my upcoming 401 course, provide a space for the collection of resources related to that preparation, and provide accountability through this blog's public nature and daily update requirements.

In contrast to previous Apprenti cohorts I and my peers have been graced with a six-week break. This break can be an opportunity or a limiting factor depending on how it is approached. I intend to maximize my learning time and take advantage of our unique situation.

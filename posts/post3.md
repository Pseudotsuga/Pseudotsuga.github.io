# Day 3 
## November 29th, 2019

Today I practiced Python by running through some basic algorithms online. 

I also had a friend over and he is a mechanical engineering student. We spoke for a while about how we could automate and remotely control various aspects of one of our mutual hobbies, brewing. 

At the very least it would be nice to make some sort of temperature control mechanism.

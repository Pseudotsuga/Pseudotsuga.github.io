Today I completed the majority of the code 401 pre-work and am confident that I can complete the rest within 1-1.5 more work days.

It was nice to reamiliarize myself with the wide range of technologies I have used in the past. 
Some I had been able to extensively dedicate time to understanding and some I had only briefly touched. 
I wish there was a more standardized format for documentation wikis. 

Tomorrow I plan on continuing my pre-work completion.

Today I worked on the weekly assignment, specifically by communicating with my group members about task delegation and by working on the conversion of the travel jackets 101 page to a more responsive design. There was a lot of copy-paste coding involved with this task but I also got to include more semantic HTML than the project had originally which is something I enjoy doing. I also established a very loose style guide for myself just to keep track of colors/font-sizes/button-styling/etc.

I was already jumping into a bit of CSS so I also used today as an opportunity to review and practice my CSS Selectors along with some more advanced CSS Selector syntax that I hadn't used previously. For example, I found out that you can use regex, or at least a form of it, within selectors. This can be extremely handy when trying to write style rulesets for different themes or I saw an example where download links were styling based on their target operating system.

# Day 2

## November 27th, 2019

I wasn't quite as productive today as I had planned on, but I am accepting of that all things considered. I watched our 301 presentations and took some notes on my own performance as well as one of my peers that I thought did well. I also investigated a few web-scraping tools, chiefly Selenium, for a side-project I've been interested in for a while but was unable to dedicate the time to during the course thus far. 

I think my goals for today may have been overambitious, but I can say with certainty I failed to account for weather. I spent about two hours shovelling snow and a few more hours commuting between family functions than I had anticipated due to the snow. Actually more accurately due to other drivers' reactions to the snow. 

Tomorrow is a new day. It is also Thanksgiving. I want to dedicate a few hours to homework and side projects but I am very hesitant to make any firm predictions because of my desire to immerse myself in family time.

Today I spent my time redoing many of the code challenges from my 301 class. 
It was an excellent refresher on various JavaScript methods, chiefly those of arrays and strings, and ways of using them to solve some abstract problems.
This was the last major component of my 401 pre-work so I should be able to submit that shortly.

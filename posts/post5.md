Today I spent some time working through codecademy JavaScript tutorials as a refresher and I also spent some time watching machine learning videos as a matter of interest. I am wanting to build a project using TensorFlow that can:

- Detect if my cat is in an image
- Expand that functionality to a video
- Produce numerical values referencing wherein the image my cat can be found
- 'Decenter' my cat within the image

The absolute stretch for me using technology would be to take it further and also write a basic script using the values produced by TensorFlow and guide a small servo-mounted laser diode. 

I also spent some time explaining some general programming concepts to my brother which I found to be very helpful in cementing my own understanding. 

Tomorrow I want to find an absolute barebones TensorFlow project and recreate it to help me understand the general mechanics of the library. I also want to look into the 401 pre-work that is now available to us and create a smart and time-associated plan of how I will approach it.

Today I watched - JavaScript the weird parts on YouTube as a review of general JavaScript concepts.

It was a good review of idiosyncrasies within the language and the topic that really stuck with me as i reflect is variable scoping and hoisting, or more specifically how those concepts apply to different variable keywords.

Tomorrow I plan on submitting some of the pre-work which I completed/consolidated prior to the canvas course being open.
